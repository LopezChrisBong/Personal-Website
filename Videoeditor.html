			<h3>Video Editor</h3>
			<div class="panel">
			    <p>As a creative and detail-oriented individual with extensive 
                    experience in video editing, I believe that my skills and passion 
                    for visual storytelling would make me an ideal fit for this role. <p>

                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I have had the pleasure of working on various projects 
                    ranging from short films to advertisements to corporate videos. With each 
                    project, I have honed my ability to bring stories to life through the art 
                    of editing. My proficiency in industry-standard software such as 
                    Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Final Cut Pro allows me to 
                    bring a high level of technical proficiency to every project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What sets me apart as a video editor is my focus on collaboration and communication. 
                    I believe that open dialogue with clients and team members is essential 
                    to ensuring that the final product meets their vision. I am committed to working
                    closely with clients to understand their goals and deliver a finished product
                     that exceeds their expectations.
